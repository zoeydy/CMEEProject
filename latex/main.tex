% The goal of this project is to quantify the population growth pattern of microbes, the duration and pattern of the lag phase especially.
Microorganisms play a vital role in ecosystems globally. Microbial population dynamics is the fundamental process of microbiology, understanding it helps us learn more about the underlying metabolic strategies. While throughout the whole life cycle temperature takes a critical role in constraining the biological rates, recent studies do not take this constraint into consideration. With a deeper understanding of the thermodynamic constraints on metabolic traits, we could improve those models to a level with higher practical application value. In this study, I aim to find general patterns of temperature-related metabolic traits. By comparing the thermal responses within and across species, I find that the intensity of adaptation is stronger observed in the lag phase, which means the ability to surpass the thermodynamic constraint is higher in the lag phase. Under the same conditions, microorganisms spontaneously putting more effort into overcoming the thermodynamic constraint in the lag phase. This adaptive phenomenon leads to interesting questions about how the underlying mechanisms allocate limited resources in coping with changing environments to make the organisms more competitive.\\

%Why would this ability is stronger in lag phase than exponential phase? Would it also stronger than stationary or decline phase? Would the ability to overcome thermodynamic constrain be indication of higher competitiveness? what is the underlying mechanism makes microorganisms allocate the limiting resources to escape the thermodynamic constrains under constantly changing environmental conditions? All those questions are fascinating to explore and better understand the world, and me in this study, started with the base understanding of the thermal response of simple single population.

\section{Introduction}

Microbes, as one of the earliest life forms, are ubiquitous on earth. They support all higher trophic organisms and maintain the health of the ecosystems \citep{whitman1998prokaryotes}. Their immense diversity, varied responses to environmental change and fast-changing generation features make it a valuable research model organism. Conversely, it is because of its complexity and diversity, studying every specific microbial system may be arduous and unrealistic. Therefore, exploring the common physiological mechanisms under microorganisms may give us more insights.\\

% Influenced by the environment, while in turn make impact on their living environment. Understanding the interactions between them and the underlying response mechanism of the microbes can give back us more knowledge of the

Microbial growth is a fundamental process in microbiology. Monitoring, interpreting and predicting the population growth of microbes inspire us to learn more about microbes. The growth curve of the microbial population can be divided into 4 phases (Fig. \ref{fig:typ_growth_pattern}): lag, exponential, stationary and decline. When encountering a new environment, microbes do not proliferate immediately, they adapt themselves to it. After this period, the population comes into its cell doubling phase. In this phase, the number of new individuals in the population appears to be proportional to the last generation. This proportion measured in the infinitesimal generation time interval, in the mathematical form $\frac{dN}{dt}$, is defined as the growth rate. The biggest growth rate at inflection point in this phase is defined as the maximum growth rate ($r_{max}$). The population cannot grow infinitely, and becomes relatively constant in the subsequent phase called the stationary phase. It may come about because of some growth-limiting factors, such as resources depletion. Due to the same or any other reasons like cell damage as stationary phase, when the fertility lies below the mortality, the population passes into the decline phase. \\
%In Fig. \ref{fig:typ_growth_pattern}, the dash line with the slope of the $r_{max}$ across the inflection point in the exponential growth phase of the growth curve intersect with the horizontal line with the y axis value of the initial population size, we get a point with the x axis value defined as $t_{lag}$, which represents the duration of the lag phase. 

In those growth phases, the intriguing phenomenon is that after inoculation, the microbial cells do not duplicate instantly. Although this was observed by Müller in 1895, after more than a century, there is still too little knowledge about them has been gained. Understanding the lag phase can deepen our understanding of microorganisms and have an application value \citep{bertrand2019lag}. For instance, the lag phase is commonly taken as the preparation period to respond to the changing environment and some suggest that microorganisms will repair some damage in the lag phase \citep{rolfe2012lag}. Understanding the strategies microbes take to cope with those damage or old cells may give back heuristic insight about ageing and longevity \citep{pin2009network}. The longer lag phase may help pathogens dodge the host immune responses, which confer increased antibiotic tolerance \citep{li2016importance}. Also, the seemingly maladaptive strategy of iron accumulation in the lag phase when the pathogen is exposed to antibiotics can reveal some underlying microbial regulation mechanisms and that instruct the use of antibiotics \citep{rolfe2012lag}.\\

Precisely modelling and predicting the growth pattern in the lag phase allows the modern refrigeratory food industry to preserve food from any organism contamination by prolonging the lag phase \citep{swinnen2004predictive,perez201318,ghidelli2018recent,adams2020microbiology}. Therefore we could boost the development of food safety and amplify the profitable fields of the food industry. In the food industry, the most commonly used and the main tool to suppress microbial growth in perishable foods is controlling temperature. In consideration of that, temperature with its critical influence on microbial metabolism \citep{brown2004toward}, provide a fundamental basis for understanding the latent mechanistic kinetic. Beyond that, the response of the soil microbes, because of the temperature perturbation, significantly influences the biogeochemical cycles \citep{davidson2006temperature}, which no creatures on earth could escape. \\
%among those factors that can influence the dynamics of the microbial population,  
%which is the primary measurement of the spoilage of the food, of any contaminating organisms present in the food, therefore. The  modeling and predicting the population growth gives food industry more informed knowledge about how to preserve food with any organism contamination from spoilage would   (double check).\\



\citealt{swinnen2004predictive} provided a framework explaining the mechanistic concept underlying the lag phase, which they define as a function of environmental change. The speed that microbes finish their work to adapt to the new environment can be expressed as $\frac{Workload}{\Delta time}$, in which $Workload$ is proportional to $\Delta Environment$, similar to \citealt{bertrand2019lag}. Recent work has shown that the duration of the lag phase is correlated to the rate of the environmental conditions change \citep{chu2016lag}. Facing the rapidly changing environment, the lag phase tends to be shorter and vice versa. From research by \citealt{chu2016lag}, we also get an insight into the microbial ability to adapt faster or grow faster. The authors believe that there is a trade-off between these two abilities. In which `grow faster' means microbe perform better in the subsequent exponential growth phase. However, as the research \citealt{chu2016lag} takes carbon source in the substrate as the environmental change, it is not clear that the same would be observed with the other environmental changes. Actually, the opposite result can be found in the study \citep{de2018determination} that there is not any trade-off between the ability to grow faster and adapt faster, rather they are positively correlated. Those microbes are studied under optimal growth conditions, except temperature and inoculation size as independent variables, monitored in the laboratory. However, in a recent study \citealt{hamill2020microbial} tried to explain the lag phase as the indicator of the stress, they claims there is no stable correlation between the length of the lag phase and the rate of growth or germination. \\


Based on the growth curve of microorganisms, is there a constant growth rate pattern? As growth rate is influenced by too many factors, such as temperature, body size, medium, inoculation size etc. It could be complicated and unrealistic to test each specific condition with an experiment. Rather than comparing the growth rate in specific conditions, there is a need to test it more generally using a mechanistic model to scale it into a generalized biological pattern. The Metabolic Theory of Ecology (MTE) \citep{brown2004toward} presents an approach. The MTE considers the dynamics of ecological systems as consequences of biological metabolism and deems the phenotypic variations within constraints on metabolic rate mainly influenced by body size, temperature and stoichiometry. In other words, most of the biological rates are governed by metabolism, so growth rate as a form of biological rate, could also be explained using MTE. \\

So far, there has been no research into the relationship between the lag phase and the exponential phase of microbes in terms of their short-term and long-term thermal responses taken into metabolism. It is therefore valuable to study the influence temperature has on the microbial growth dynamic of the lag and exponential phase focusing on the underlying metabolic relationship. In this study, I collected the microbial population growth data from Samraat Pawar's laboratory, the Department of Life Science, Imperial College. Those data are from 21 previous studies on microbial population growth that incorporated 94 species. By fitting the Boltzmann–Arrhenius model according to MTE, using data points within the Operational Temperature Range (OTR), we can get metabolic activation energy which represents the thermal responses of microbes in lag and exponential phase. \citealt{smith2019community} studied the adaptation by comparing the short-term and long-term thermal response of microbe using the maximum growth rate ($r_{max}$). I used the same method to compare the degree of adaptation between lag and exponential growth phases. I aim to infer some properties, for example, adaptability and potential metabolic mechanism, of microbes in the lag and exponential phases. \\
% not just comparing the growth rate under specific conditions which could be complex and unpredictable, can we by any means examining the underlying general mechanistic biological pattern and comparing the representative indicators to get more robust result?  1. at least chu2016lag say it could be a trade-off 2. chu2016lag say that just based on one study, it might not generally true 3. it could be complicated to do it more generally with an experiment 4. got data set to study, mention the lag size... 5. and need a  to explain it


% following up MTE, temperature is a critical confounding factor, that would affect maximum growth rate, duration of lag phase, in previous study did not taken into temperature...
% conversion the nutrients in the environment to biomass and maintain the base metabolism rate, the energy can represent the physiological status of the population[citation]\\
% Individuals within population undergo specific physiological responses during each phase for coping with the consistently changing environment. For understanding the thermal response of each phase, I consider quantifying the metabolism rates in lag and exponential phase. In this study, the rates are approximated by measuring duration of lag phase and take the reciprocal of this value as the transitional state growth rate ($t_{lag}$) and maximum growth rate ($r_{max}$) in exponential growth phase. For analysing the temperature effect on the metabolism rate of microbial growth follows the thermal-dynamic constrains can be quantified by the Arrhenius model \citep{peleg2012arrhenius} \\

%The specific metabolic properties of a microbe are the major factors in determining that microbe's ecological niche, and often allow for that microbe to be useful in industrial processes or responsible for biogeochemical cycles.\\

% Apart from reasons listed above can influence the duration of the lag phase, there are also some other explainations like...

% while recently there were already substantial evidence show that even genetically identical microbial has variation in the ability of adapting to the new environment, in the specific population \citep{vermeersch2019duration}. And 

% It can be influenced by the history of the microbes and the magnitude of the change between the preceding and the present conditions. and 'damaged' microbes always has longer lag phase\\

% after, there is still  when refers to a single cell, this period is defined as the from the inoculation till the first division. However, 

% As within this period, there is variation not only within the species of the biochemical, physiological and metabolic reactions but also exist among the population. The different transcriptomic, proteomic, and evolutionary features can also as the criteria of defining the lag phase.

% What causes the lag phase? What factors influence the duration of it? What can we infer from the phenomenon observed in the lag phase? Would longer lag phase mean better adaptation or opposite, and can we find the answer observing the subsequent exponential phase? Would there be any trade-off between the ability of adapt faster and grow faster? \\

%controlling temperature is the major means to preserve the food and delay the spoilage of the food, because it is the factor can influence both the duration of the lag phase and the maximum growth rate in microbes exponential growth rate \citep{}, within those two phase is the most effective duration can control the microbial growth. 

% After \citep{jacob1961genetic}, there have already loads of investigations towards explaining the mechanism underlying this phenomenon mostly focus on carbon source switches, but among those known or unknown mechanism, we know too little about what controls the duration of the lag phase \citep{yates2007lag}, which could have strong explanation power of adaptability of microbes. \\

%Why there are some individual differences regarding to the duration of the lag time? Would it represent the ability to adapt to the new environment? If one community adapt faster, can it grow faster or slower later on? \\

%It is reasonable to say, in order to out-compete other organism, it is beneficial to grow as fast as possible after inoculation, while there have already loads of phenomenon show that the duration of the lag phase can vary from minutes to years. Harsh environment can in some extend explain the very long duration of the lag phase, but how can we explain the relative slower individuals in adapting to a new environment? More confusing about it is why the variance exist among individuals with the identical gene within the same community? \\

%What is the most optimal strategy when a microbes move to a new environment? Would it be possible that some seems like sub-optimal strategy is actually the most optimal strategy for some reason say frequency dependent selection can act on it, or any drawback of it makes the benefit of employing sub-optimal strategy out-compete the cost of optimal one? \\

\section{Methods}

I used the parameters $r_{max}$, $t_{lag}$ (Fig. \ref{fig:typ_growth_pattern}) as the real and reciprocal of the metabolic rate to estimate the thermal response ($E$) of microbes in exponential and lag phases. These metabolic parameters were obtained by fitting the modified Gompertz model. And the activation energy $E$ is by fitting the Boltzmann–Arrhenius model according to MTE. All the computation, analyses and plotting were done in R 4.1.1.\\
% fitted  and  to get parameters  and activation energy . And compared short-term (intra-specific, $\bar{E}_S$) and long-term (inter-specific, $E_L$) activation energy. 

\subsection{Data Collection}

The data were collected from 21 papers on microbial population growth under different abiotic conditions. The whole data set comprises around 94 species and across temperature range from -4$^{\circ}$C to 37$^{\circ}$C (for the detail refer to supplementary information \ref{Data_SI} on page \pageref{Data_SI}).\\

\subsection{Estimating Growth Rate Parameters}
\begin{equation} 
\label{eqn:GompEqn}
    log(N_t)= N_0 + (N_{max} - N_0) e^{-e^{r_{max} exp^{(1)}  {\frac{t_{lag}-t}{(N_{max}-N_0)log(10)}\\} +1}}
\end{equation}
The modified Gompertz Model \citep{zwietering1990modeling} is wildly validated as an appropriate model, which is frequently used to describe the growth of population and each parameter in the equation has biological meaning. Therefore, I use it to estimate the two metabolic rate parameters: $r_{max}$ and $t_{lag}$, which are taken as fitness measurements in this study too. \\

Before fitting the Gompertz model, I deleted data with incorrect species names and with negative population sizes, which do not have biological meanings. Then, as the model has used the logarithm of population size, I also deleted the population size that has the value of 0 and takes the logarithm of it ($log(N)$). And for fitting the model, it also requires a sufficient degree of freedom in each fitting. There are 4 parameters in the Gompertz model (equation \ref{eqn:GompEqn}), so the data set that has less than 5 points were also deleted. Moreover, each fitting means fitting the model on each data set under the same experimental conditions. So the ID value contains information of species, medium, temperature and citation is given to each data point. The data points with the same ID value are taken as a data set. After the above steps, 809 valid data sets could be used in model fitting.\\

The model was fitted using Non-linear Least-squares, \texttt{nlsLM()} function in R based on the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. The estimated parameters in fitting the Gompertz model (equation \ref{eqn:GompEqn}) were sampled 1000 times and retained the parameters in the fitting with the minimum AIC value. The AIC value is a criterion for evaluating the goodness of fit. \\
% this project to estimate the maximum growth rate $r_{max}$ and lag phase growth rate $t_{lag}$, taken as the direct measure of fitness of microbes in exponential and lag phase respectively in this study, by fitting the  so that each parameters in equation has biological meanings. Among those parameters, I use $r_{max}$ and $1/t_{lag}$ to represent the growth rate of the lag and exponential phase. \\

% In this study, the modified Gompertz \citep{zwietering1990modeling} model was used to fit and generate estimated lag and exponential phase fitness, the growth rate of the two phases($t_{lag}$ and $r_{max}$). And for researching the thermal response of those two phase, I follow the method used in this study \citep{smith2019community} using the Arrhenius model by considering the physical chemistry kinetic factor of inferring the thermodynamic status of the population. After fitting the model, I can get the thermal sensitivity value ($E_a$, E hereafter) of both stages and by comparing the activation energy patterns shown within and across species and examining the short- and long-term of the thermal response of the patter observed across species, the relationship between the lag and exponential phase can be obtained and further inference about the competitive ability of different strains.\\

\subsection{Determining the Operational Temperature Range}
The organisms have their own Operational Temperature Range, studying their metabolic rate out of this range does not provide too much practical significance. And also the Arrhenius model would not be applicable out of the bound, for it requires the reaction rates to increase monotonically with temperature \citep{peleg2012arrhenius}. The normal temperature range for most organisms falls into 0 to 40$^\circ$C \citep{thompson1942growth} and I scatter plotted the growth rates changing V.S. temperature. By roughly examining the general trend of it, I take 30$^\circ$C as the upper limit of the operational temperature range.\\

\subsection{Calculating the Activation Energy}

The MTE equation (equation \ref{eqn:MTE}) builds on allometric equations (equation \ref{eqn:allo}) \citep{kleiber1932body} and the Boltzmann–Arrhenius model (equation \ref{eqn:ArrheEqn}) that explains the mass- and temperature-correlated rate respectively. However, studies have already proven that only mass-specific metabolic rates change in response to temperature \citep{schramski2015metabolic}. So the mass-specific rate of metabolism $B$ scales as the equation \ref{eqn:MTE_mass} by dividing $M^{\frac{3}{4}}$ on both sides of the equation \ref{eqn:MTE}. \\
\begin{equation}
    \label{eqn:allo}
    Y = Y_0 M^{\frac{3}{4}}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \label{eqn:ArrheEqn}
    B = B_0 e^{-\frac{E_a}{k T}}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \label{eqn:MTE}
    I = I_0 M^{\frac{3}{4}} e^{-\frac{E}{k T}}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \label{eqn:MTE_mass}
    B = B_0 M^{-\frac{1}{4}} e^{-\frac{E}{k T}}
\end{equation}
% Van’t Hoff-Arrhenius model

This dissertation takes temperature as the critical confounding factor, so incorporate the $ M^{-\frac{1}{4}} $ into constant $B_0$ in equation \ref{eqn:MTE_mass} comes to the same pattern as Boltzmann–Arrhenius equation \ref{eqn:ArrheEqn}, the actual model being fitted. So that $B_0$ is the normalization constant independent of body size, temperature and other abiotic factors. $Y_0$ in equation \ref{eqn:allo} and $I_0$ in equation \ref{eqn:MTE} are also constants. $B$ in equation \ref{eqn:ArrheEqn} is explained as the frequency that the collisions result in a reaction. Under this specific dissertation, it is taken as the mass-specific biological growth rate under consideration of MTE. $Y$ in equation \ref{eqn:allo} and $I$ in equation \ref{eqn:MTE} represent whole-organism metabolic rate.  $E_a$ is the apparent activation energy, correspondingly $E$ is the metabolic activation energy. $K$ is the Boltzmann constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature in Kelvin. \\

In the same circumstance as the Gompertz model, the log transformation process and sufficient degree of freedom requirements need to be handle. Those two metabolic trait parameters, $r_{max}$ and $1/t_{lag}$, were log-transformed. Before that, non-positive estimated parameters were deleted. Each within species fitting used the data sets with the same species, more than one temperature and more than 2 data points data sets. The across species fitting used the highest metabolic rate parameters in the fitting within species. Both fitting used \texttt{lm()} function in R 4.1.1. \\
\begin{equation}
    \label{eqn:logArrheEqn}
    ln(B) = ln(B_0) - \frac{E}{k T}
\end{equation}



\subsection{Comparison of Thermal Response Patterns}
\begin{figure}[!htb]

\includegraphics[width=0.95\linewidth]{Plot/E_short_long_cite.pdf}
\caption{Thermal Response Patterns}\label{fig:E_short_long_cite}
\flushleft{\normalsize copy from \citep{smith2019community}. The coloured lines are intra-specific Thermal Performance Curve (TPC) used to calculate intra-specific activation energy, which represents the short-term thermal response. The black line, using only the trait value under the optimum condition ($P_{opt}$) to generate inter-specific activation energy, corresponds to long-term thermal response. Inset panel in a shows how the plot would be like in the Boltzmann-Arrhenius model. $\bar{E}_S$ is the mean intra-specific activation values (the absolute values of the slope of the colored lines in panel plot), correspondingly $E_L$ is the black line. Larger activation energy value represents larger thermal constrains (larger thermal sensitivity), short-term. So by comparing the difference of the short-term and long-term activation energy, we can infer the degree of the adaptation. In this plot, the three circumstances are: \textbf{a} there is no adaptation, the short-term activation energy ($\bar{E}_S$) is statistically indistinguishable from the long-term (${E}_L$). The metabolism rate is completely constrained by the thermodynamic \textbf{b} Natual selection defeats thermoconstrains completely. \textbf{c} Intermedium senarial that the microbes is partialy adapted.}
\end{figure}
The estimated parameters $log(1/t_{lag})$ and $log(r_{max})$ are scatter plotted to get an overview of the general relation between them. The regression line was gotten by using the 'loess' method in the ggplot2 package with 95\% prediction bounds. Then, a more precise quantitative comparison is exerted to get the activation energy by fitting the Boltzmann-Arrhenius model.\\

As shown in Fig. \ref{fig:E_short_long_cite}, the short-term ($\bar{E}_S$) and long-term (${E}_L$) activation energy in both lag and exponential phases had been computed and compared to infer the thermal sensitivity and the degree of adaptation in each growth phases. Each short-term Arrhenius fitting used the data set with the same species and got the short-term activation energy $E_S$. Intra-specific (short-term) thermal response ($\bar{E}_{S}$) of microbes were calculated by taking the average of intra-species activation energy $E_S$. The long-term fitting used the data points across species, each at the optimal temperature in the short-term fitting. The optimal temperature at which these data points are located has the largest average growth rate in each short-term fitting. \\

% Es EL can also taken as average rate? 
% Conclusion: the metabolic rate in lag phase is more constrained by thermodynamic. what does the E from MLE mean, underlying?

% If the temperature before changing is already the optimal temperature leading to optimal growth rate, the natural selection would select the individual with lower activation energy, so that, it would not influenced by the temperature perturbation too much? but the thermal constraints within species is hard to evolve. So adopt the explanation above!\\

\subsection{Correlation Between Growth Rate Parameters}

\subsection{Thermal Response Comparison}

For both growth phases, the $\bar{E}_{S} > E_L > 0$ (Fig. \ref{fig:E_comp}, table \ref{table:E_mean}), follows the pattern in \textbf{c} of Fig. \ref{fig:E_short_long_cite}. As explained in Fig. \ref{fig:E_short_long_cite} about inferring the strength of the thermodynamic constraints on ectotherms. My result shows the thermal sensitivities are partially constrained by thermodynamic. In other words, selection does not completely override thermodynamic constraints, but there is some biochemical adaptation. Further detail about the activation energy of each species can be found in the supplementary information (Fig. \ref{fig:E_Spe}, table \ref{table:E_rmax_table} and table \ref{table:E_tlag_table}). \\

Moreover, if we take the difference between short-term and long-term activation energy ($\bar{E}_S - E_L$) estimated from metabolic traits as the degree of adaptation. In my result, estimating this measurement from parameter $1/t_{lag}$ is higher than from $r_{max}$ means the intensity of adaptation is stronger observed in the lag phase. \\

%From that we can infer there is acclimation during lag to exponential phase. Especially, if you consider the higher activation energy as stronger thermal sensitivity (less adapt to climate change), the short-term thermal response in exponential phase($\bar{E}_{S_{(r_{max})}}$) is higher than in lag phase($\bar{E}_{S_{(t_{lag})}}$), but the long-term thermal response in exponential phase($E_{L_{(r_{max})}}$) is even lower than in lag phase($E_{L_{(t_{lag})}}$) shows much acclimation ability in exponential phase. Further, by visually compare the $\bar{E}_{S}$ values estimated from exponential and lag phase, they are not significantly different, combined with the analysis above, it could tell that most of the acclimation appears in the exponential growth phase, it could also say that lag phase is more sensitive to temperature. \\

\section{Discussion}

% retreat from the beginning
This study examined the thermal response of two key metabolic traits (duration of lag phase and exponential growth rate) of microbes within and across species. I find stronger evidence for adaptation of the lag phase compared to the exponential phase. As under same constant experimental conditions, the stronger ability to suppress the thermodynamic constrain in lag phase could be achieved by the underlying metabolic mechanism of microbes. It got me to think that if this adaptation is autonomous, it is likely a response to selection for the ability of microorganisms to allocate limiting resources adjusting to the better metabolic rate in coping with constantly changing environmental conditions, such as different temperatures. \\

%The first result of a positive correlation between the two metabolic traits (Fig. \ref{fig:log_rt_col_temp}), agrees with recent work \citep{de2018determination}. While it is also compared in various specific conditions that each metabolic traits are estimated from the data sets with same environmental conditions. Further analysis calculating activation energy will let us see the general underlying patterns of microbial thermodynamic responses in exponential and lag growth phases. \\ 

The result that the short-term thermal sensitivity is higher in the lag phase than in exponential phase is contradicts to the results of \citealt{de2018determination},  who found that $r_{max}$ has the higher short-term thermal sensitivity (table \ref{table:E_comp_table}). The predicted activation energy values from two metabolic traits in this study were both relatively higher than those found by previous works \citealt{de2018determination} and \citealt{smith2019community}. This could be because I used \texttt{lm()} function in R to fit the Boltzmann-Arrhenius model, it may probably happen to use the steepest curve of the Temperature Performance Curve so got the higher value. Despite this potential limitation my result comparing the activation energy from both exponential and lag phases would not be affected, because the comparison is under the same temperature range. Further work could use the Sharpe–Schoolfield model \citep{shi2010comparison} as an alternative to Boltzmann–Arrhenius model. It would obtain a more precise Operational Temperature Range below the highest metabolic traits. So that the activation energy values may not as higher as in my study, it may lead to different result in further research. \\

%\subsection{Diauxic Growth Pattern}
Multi carbon substrate supply is another widely concerning environmental factor that could cause the lag phase in the microbial growth curve. Facing several carbon resources, the microbes switch hierarchically between them from the most favourite to the least, leading to biphasic growth curves also called diauxic growth \citep{monod1949growth}. During these diauxic phases, the microbes could be vulnerable to harsh perturbations such as heat, as they are undergoing processes adjusting to the new environment. Could the duration of the lag phase be a stress indicator \citep{hamill2020microbial}? Understanding the underlying mechanism of microbes' special sensitivity to temperature change could make them the eco-friendly guide organisms used to monitor environmental change. \\
%and maintain the ecosystems function. \\
% Most of the works in this field focus on the underlying molecular regulations and the the well-known phenomenon -- the crabtree effect: glucose-induced repression of genes involved in the uptake and metabolism of alternative carbohydrates \citep{perez2018crabtree}. The study of the general metabolic pattern can also further the understanding of such field. \\

% \subsection{Short-term and Long-term Comparison}
My result that the difference of activation energy calculated from the lag phase is higher than from the exponential phase suggests that there is more adaptation in the lag phase. In other words, it is less restricted by thermodynamics. Following the approach of \citealt{hamill2020microbial}, further research could also investigate whether the reduced thermal restriction or also higher degree of adaptability of the lag phase, could be an indication of stronger competitive ability. Furthermore, as the lag phase is the initial growth phase that microbes enter, the metabolic strategies they employ could have a profound influence on their competitiveness in later life cycles. \\

% \subsection{Dynamic Interaction}
If we want to analyse the competitive ability of species from the perspective of thermal response patterns of metabolic traits, the trait values estimated in my study alone are not enough. Because in my research, the fitness of the population is assessed independently of other perturbations or interactions in the systems, which is a less perfect reflection of what really happens in the real world. In the real world, microbial populations mostly exists as a component of communities interacting with other species and influenced by environmental conditions. If we want to understand the broader microbial communities, we need to understand those interactions incorporating microbial community structures, dynamics, functions and networks etc. \\

For obtaining more reliable predictions of competitiveness, a more precise determination of the fitness of a genotype is required. The in-silico simulation could be an ideal way to achieve this. For example, a recent study has constructed an approach to predict relative density-dependent fitness accounting for the effects of each growth cycle on fitness \citep{ram2019predicting}. This research took culture medium as a variable, a similar future work could be constructed to predict relative fitness based on thermal response. \\

Models incorporating species interactions and environmental perturbations can also be found in recent studies \citep{rodrigues2021community, pacciani2020dynamic, li2020modeling}. \citealt{rodrigues2021community} considered resource competition. They incorporated demographic composition and found that cooperative behaviour in the early and late life span are both not favoured. They also found that niche expansion can promote mutualism. \citealt{pacciani2020dynamic} studied dynamic metabolic adaptation as a mechanism to maintain biodiversity. Incorporating thermal constraints in their model could make it more useful in practical applications. While \citealt{pacciani2020dynamic} just assign the metabolic rate value in the model, \citep{li2020modeling} built a model that makes it dynamic, mapping from metabolic strategies to fitness consequences. Their model is based on resource-competition models using the adaptive dynamic technique, but in contrast to the adaptive dynamic technique, it takes the metabolic rate as dynamic. In their study, \citealt{li2020modeling} found the dynamic fitness landscape is changing with species-environment feedback. On that basis, \citealt{li2020modeling} studied how could the microbes allocate the resource to maintain the most fitness metabolic behaviour. Further research similar to \citealt{li2020modeling} could incorporate temperature as a critical factor influencing metabolic strategies. \\ % \citealt{li2020modeling} under the conditions of chemostat

% There are some short-comings of my analysis:  \subsection{Caveats}
My study has some limitations that could be addressed with future work. The calculation of short-term thermal responses $\bar{E}_{S_{rmax}}$ and $\bar{E}_{S_{tlag}}$ are simply the average of activation energy of each species. An alternative approach would be to cancel the bias from poor fitting data sets by taking the weighted average instead. The data sets in my study were collected for analysing the growth rate of the microbes, it is not guaranteed that each species strain contains a series of temperatures so that it can be used to examining the microbes' response to temperature. For this reason, in my study, many data sets were invalid. A larger data size (table \ref{table:E_mean}) may lead to a different result and could be more persuasive. And collecting experiment data use temperature as the independent variable is more suitable for this study.\\

% Conclusion
% Given the critical role of microorganisms in ecology, a wide range of applications come with it. 
In this study, by comparing the metabolic traits I found different degrees of adaptation in life cycles, which could lead to stronger competitiveness of microbes. While throughout the whole life cycle temperature takes a critical role in constraining biological rates, recent studies do not take this constrain into consideration. The results of this study deepen our understanding of thermodynamic constraints on metabolic traits, thus laying the foundation for understanding mechanisms underlying competition between microbial taxa across environmental gradients. \\


%Because in early stage the costs surpass the benefits and in late stage due to the resource depletion.

%In study \citep{rodrigues2021community} they found that the helping behaviour in the early and late life span are both not favoured. Because in early stage......they assume the carrying capacity is fixed. In such zero-sum game, competition of limiting resources which must take the fitness as dencity-dependent , could the early stage deficiency of providing help to relative species is constrained by the metabolic rate which is constrained by the thermodynamic? 
% \citep{rodrigues2021community} also the evolution of cooperation is influenced by the intrinsic growth rate of species compete for shared resources, it can neither be too slow to be surpassed by partner species, nor too high of exclude the relative species.  \\

%2. competition
%Many previous work take the environment as static, simplified the work of natural selection as finding the maximum strategy on the stationary fitness landscape. The adaptive dynamic also known as evolutionary invasion analysis, provided a framework of addressing long-term evolution of traits taken the fitness as the density dependent. Although the adaptive dynamics models have already considered the interaction of other species, the environment is also constantly changing corresponding to the feadback from individuals in the community. Recent study \citep{li2020modeling} based on the idea of adaptive dynamics, measures the fitness of composition in the study system considering the specific environment conditions. The improvement of this model modified the measurement of the fitness not only is frequency dependent, which only consider the competition relationship but also incorporate the environmental influencing factors.
