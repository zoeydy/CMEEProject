# **Recommendations for Fittinf Microbial Growth Models**

## About
Author: Sam Turner

This directory contains the code and data required to compile my miniproject. To perform the analysis and compile the write up, call **run_MiniProject.sh** from within the **code** directory. Please allow up to **10 minutes** for the report to compile, as the model fitting takes about this long. Once the report has compiled, it will be placed as the only item in the **report** directory.

The directory contains 4 subdirectories:
**code** contains the required scripts
**data** contains the initial data, and will be where intermediate data is placed
**results** is where the figures will be stored
**writeup** is where the writeup will be written to
